# Random Forest Regression
### A short summary for Random Forest Regression

### Ensemble Learning
Ensemble method is a technique that combines the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms together to make more accurate predictions.A model comprised of many models is called an Ensemble model.

### Random Forest Regression
Random Forest which illustrates the power of combining many decision trees into one model and is a Supervised Learning algorithm which uses **Ensemble learning method** for classification and regression. Random Forest is used for Stock Market fields, E-Commerce fields and etc..
